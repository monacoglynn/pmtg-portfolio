My portfolio of code projects

I started by making a main outline of the page. Creating the header with h1 and nav bar. I styled that with a background color and spaced each element on either end of the header.

I used flex box to arrange the main part of the page, created some pseudo classes for a tags and my workbox projects. Making the first project bigger than the rest was a struggle. I set the flex-basis to the min of my large screen size so that it would always take up the whole page width.
